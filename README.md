# Abacus Book Calculator

## Introduction
Welcome to TheKiddoRajveer's Abacus Book Calculator! An amazing CLI-based calculator designed for solving your Abacus Book rapidly and fastly.

## How it Works
1. The program prompts the user to choose an operation from the menu.
2. Depending on the selected operation, the user is prompted to input the required numbers.
3. The program performs the specified mathematical operation and displays the result.
4. Users can continue performing operations or exit the program by entering any other number.

## Operations Menu
- **Calculate Cube (`case 1`):**
  - User inputs a single number to calculate its cube.
  - The program uses `cin` to read the input and calculates the cube using `pow(number, 3)`.

- **Calculate Square (`case 2`):**
  - User inputs a single number to calculate its square.
  - The program uses `cin` to read the input and calculates the square using `pow(number, 2)`.

- **Perform Addition (`case 3`):**
  - User inputs 12 numbers (separated by spaces) to perform addition.
  - The program uses a loop to read each input and calculates the sum.

- **Perform Multiplication (`case 4`):**
  - User inputs 10 pairs of numbers (separated by spaces) to perform multiplication.
  - The program uses a loop to read each pair, multiplies them, and displays the result.

- **Perform Division (`case 5`):**
  - User inputs 10 pairs of numbers (separated by spaces) to perform division.
  - The program uses a loop to read each pair, checks for division by zero, and displays the result.

## Usage
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform desired mathematical operations.
